DGM is a cross-platform C++ library implementing various tasks in probabilistic graphical models with pairwise and complete (dense) dependencies. The library aims to be used for the Markov and Conditional Random Fields (MRF / CRF),
Markov Chains, Bayesian Networks, _etc_. Specifically, it includes a variety of methods for the following tasks:
* __Learning__: Training of unary and pairwise potentials
* __Inference / Decoding__: Computing the conditional probabilities and the most likely configuration
* __Parameter Estimation__: Computing maximum likelihood (or MAP) estimates of the parameters
* __Evaluation / Visualization__: Evaluation and visualization of the classification results
* __Data Analysis__: Extraction, analysis and visualization of valuable knowlage from training data
* __Feature Engineering__: Extraction of various descriptors from images, which are useful for classification

These tasks are optimized for speed, _i.e._ high-efficient calculations. The code is written in optimized C++17, compiled with Microsoft Visual Studio, Xcode or GCC and can take advantage of multi-core processing as well as GPU computing. DGM is released under a BSD license and hence it is free for both academic and commercial use.
