If you have a question rather than reporting a bug please go to http://project-10.de/forum/viewforum.php?f=31 where you get much faster responses.

Please:
* Read the documentation to test with the latest developer build.
* Check if other person has already created the same issue to avoid duplicates. You can comment on it if there already is an issue.
* Try to be as detailed as possible in your report.
* Report only one problem per created issue.
